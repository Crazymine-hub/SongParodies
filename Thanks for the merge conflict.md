It's gonna make you bend an break
(Another commit came before)
Say a prayer and let the fun begin
Because git didn't help
(Let the fun begin, let the fun begin)

And I'm editing to make things right
But the messed up code doesn't come to life
"Who do they think, they are?"
If that's the best you've got better put your fingers back to the keys

One night and one more time
Thanks for the Merge Conflict
Even though that's not your task
"It looks like mine only messed up?!"

One night (yeah) and one more file
Thanks for the Merge Conflict
Thanks for the Merge Conflict
See "It looks like yours only better"


Im looking forward to resolving
but i'm slowly getting tired
And you've got no comments

It would be easy if not for, if not for
all your useless names, useless names
One night work
One night worked through

One night and one more time
Thanks for the Merge Conflict
Even though that's not your task
"It looks like mine only messed up?!"

One night (yeah) and one more file
Thanks for the Merge Conflict
Thanks for the Merge Conflict
See "It looks like yours only better"

I say you only cared
of getting your code to compile
But now running
this mess is longer by six times

You are out of your mind
Getting me to fix this
im a line away from
nuking this from orbit.

One night and one more time

One more night, one more time
(One night and one more time)
Thanks for the Merge Conflicts
Even though they weren't so great
"That is my code only fucked up"


One whole night, all those files
(One night and all those files)
Thanks for the Merge Conflicts
Thanks for the Merge Conflicts
See I'll just do git push --force
